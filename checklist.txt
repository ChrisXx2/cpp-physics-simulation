Short-term (Immediate)

Add input validation - Check for negative gravity, invalid drag coefficients
Configurable simulation - Let users set duration and timestep
Better output formatting - Use fixed-width formatting for cleaner display
CSV export - Save simulation data for plotting in external tools
Preset scenarios - Offer common setups (projectile, freefall, etc.)

Medium-term (Next Phase)

2D boundaries - Add ground collision detection
Multiple particle types - Different masses, sizes, materials
Additional forces - Wind, magnetic fields, springs
Energy conservation tracking - Monitor total energy to validate physics
Particle-particle interactions - Simple collision detection

Long-term (Future Vision)

3D simulation - Extend to three dimensions
Real-time visualization - Use a graphics library (SDL2, SFML, or OpenGL)
Configuration files - Load scenarios from JSON/XML
Advanced physics - Rotation, angular momentum, deformation
GUI interface - Interactive parameter adjustment
Performance optimization - Spatial partitioning for many particles

Recommended Roadmap

Improved data output formatting

Phase 3 (1 month): Visualization

Integrate SDL2 or SFML for graphics
Real-time 2D rendering
Interactive controls (pause, reset, speed adjustment)

Phase 4 (1-2 months): Advanced physics

Particle-particle collisions
Variable forces (wind gusts, etc.)
Multiple simultaneous forces
Spring connections between particles

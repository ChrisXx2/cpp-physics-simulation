🟦 Week 3 — Daily Checklist
✅ Week 3 — Day 1
From acceleration to forces

☐ Remove acceleration from Particle
☐ Add netForce to Particle
☐ Add applyForce(double)
☐ Add clearForces()
☐ Compute acceleration inside update() using F = ma
☐ Update main.cpp to apply gravity as a force
☐ Verify motion matches previous gravity-only behavior
☐ Commit / save stable version

✅ Week 3 — Day 2
Multiple forces & force composition

☐ Apply **more than one force per particle
☐ Add linear drag force
☐ Verify drag reduces velocity over time
☐ Ensure forces reset each timestep
☐ Confirm order of force application doesn’t matter
☐ Add comments explaining each force
☐ Print net force once for debugging
☐ Save clean working version

✅ Week 3 — Day 3
Separating force logic from Particle

☐ Create ForceGenerator base class
☐ Create GravityForce class
☐ Create DragForce class
☐ Move gravity logic out of main.cpp
☐ Apply forces via generator objects
☐ Ensure Particle has no physics constants
☐ Test with gravity-only and drag-only cases
☐ Clean up includes & headers

✅ Week 3 — Day 4
World / Simulation control

☐ Create World or Simulation class
☐ Move particle update loop into World
☐ Store particles inside World
☐ Store force generators inside World
☐ Implement step(dt) function
☐ Replace physics logic in main.cpp
☐ Confirm output matches earlier versions
☐ Add simulation time tracking

✅ Week 3 — Day 5
Stability, review, and polish

☐ Review class responsibilities
☐ Ensure invariants still hold
☐ Remove unused variables
☐ Improve naming consistency
☐ Add brief comments where intent isn’t obvious
☐ Test edge cases (zero velocity, large dt)
☐ Decide what moves to Week 4
☐ Final commit / snapshot

🧠 End-of-week sanity check

You should be able to answer yes to all of these:

☐ Can I add a new force without modifying Particle?
☐ Is physics logic outside main.cpp?
☐ Do particles accumulate forces cleanly each step?
☐ Is the code easier to extend than last week?

If yes → you’re on track.

One sentence to remember

Week 3 is about structure, not speed.
